# heat-engine
Think and create heat engine and visualise it's PV Curve and efficiency using your own PV relationships and predefined relations!

---
# Purpose

1. Study various types of processes and there variations of predefined or custom processes.

    Predefined processes include :
    - Isothermal Process
    - Adiabatic Process
    - Isotropic Process
1. Study the heat transfer, work done and change in internal energy of these processes and heat engine
1. Study Heat Enigine and Carnot Engine
1. Build a simple carnot engine with given restrictions and study it's efficiency
1. Think and create a heat engine with your custom processes and visualize it's PV curve along with it's efficiency.

# Usage

**Note** : This is an initial implementation of the project with basic features, functions, processes and heat-engine. I will be looking forward to work further fixing it's errors and interpret results more visually and efficiently.

- Install [all required dependencies](requirements.txt)
- If you are interested in only processes, launch the [`gui.py`](gui.py) for a simple GUI usage
- For other usage, study the script using [jupyter notebook provided](heat_engine.ipynb) using platform/IDE of your choice. [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/) is also a feasible option
- Import the [`themodynamic_logic.py`](themodynamic_logic.py) script in you working folder
- Import the functions and classes
    ```python
    from themodynamic_logic import *
    ```
- Think and show your creativity!
